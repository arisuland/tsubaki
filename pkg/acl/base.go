package acl

// BaseAcl is the base ACL structure for any Tsubaki object.
// It provides a base set of functions and variables to help you
// construct ACLs within your projects.
//
// Though, this is for advanced purposes (i.e, customizable behaviour between members,
// doing bitwise operators, etc). If you wish to stick with switches to determine permissions
// on members, this is not needed.
